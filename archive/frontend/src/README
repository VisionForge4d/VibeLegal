# VibeLegal Archive

This repository preserves working files and components that were removed from the main [`VibeLegal`](https://github.com/VisionForge4d/VibeLegal) project.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

- `frontend/src/` â€“ Original UI components
- `frontend/src/pages/` â€“ Page-level React components
- `_notes/` â€“ Provenance, SHA records, and rescue logs

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This archive acts as a code museum â€” it lets us track past designs, recover old logic, and avoid accidental loss of working patterns.

No ongoing development happens here.
