# Handoff Anchor â€” ops
ðŸ—“ Last touched: 2025-07-27 22:00:00

ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus:
- [x] Backend server working with contract generation (Groq API via LLaMA3 confirmed)
- [x] Frontend template is running locally (Vite on port 5175)
- [x] Able to generate and view contracts from UI
- [ ] Finalize basic contract saving/retrieval flow

ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
- [ ] Add `.env` file to frontend (`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`)
- [ ] Refactor contract generation error handling (UI + backend)
- [ ] Confirm frontend token is sent with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- [ ] Add logout functionality
- [ ] Implement basic profile/account page (for testing tier logic)
- [ ] Add API route for tier upgrades (stub is fine)
- [ ] Add `Makefile` or `dev.sh` to run backend + frontend in one command

ðŸ§  Context Notes:
- `completion is not defined` was due to axios result not being scoped or declared; fixed by properly assigning `const completion = await axios.post(...)`.
- Running `npm run dev` in both frontend and backend is now standard.
- Server and client work if launched independently â€” shared port awareness is good (`5175`, `5000`).
- One prior issue was caused by a missing closing brace at the bottom of `server.js`.
- Error `EADDRINUSE` means port was already occupied; resolved by killing rogue processes or letting Vite bump ports.
- Project uses Groq `llama3-70b-8192` model for generation (working as of last run).
