- **Database**: PostgreSQL with native pg driver
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcryptjs for password hashing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for contract generation
- **Security**: CORS enabled, rate limiting, input validation

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: User accounts with subscription tiers and usage tracking
- **Contracts Table**: Generated contracts with metadata and content

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up VibeLegal, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher)
- **OpenAI API Key** (for contract generation)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vibelegal
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/vibelegal
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
```

#### Database Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `vibelegal`
2. Run the database schema:
```bash
psql -d vibelegal -f database.sql
```

#### Start Backend Server
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is occupied)

### 4. Verify Installation

1. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL
2. You should see the VibeLegal landing page
3. Try registering a new account (requires backend and database to be running)
4. Test contract generation (requires valid OpenAI API key)

## üöÄ Deployment

### Backend Deployment

#### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are set in your production environment:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing

#### Production Considerations
- Use a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Configure a reverse proxy (nginx) for better performance
- Set up database backups and monitoring
- Implement logging and error tracking

### Frontend Deployment

#### Build for Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

#### Deploy Static Files
The `dist` folder contains all static files that can be deployed to:
- **Static Hosting**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare
- **Web Server**: nginx, Apache

#### Environment Configuration
Update API endpoints in the frontend code to point to your production backend URL.

### Database Deployment

#### Production Database Setup
1. Set up a PostgreSQL instance (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.)
2. Run the database schema from `backend/database.sql`
3. Configure connection pooling for better performance
4. Set up regular backups
5. Monitor database performance and usage

## üîß Configuration

### OpenAI Configuration
The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for contract generation. You can modify the model and parameters in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // or "gpt-4" for better quality
  messages: [...],
  max_tokens: 2000,
  temperature: 0.3, // Lower for more consistent output
});
```

### Rate Limiting
Default rate limiting is set to 10 requests per minute per IP. Modify in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute
const MAX_REQUESTS = 10; // requests per window
```

### Subscription Tiers
- **Basic**: 25 contracts per month
- **Premium**: Unlimited contracts

Modify limits in the contract generation endpoint as needed.
