# Internal Logic for California Employment Agreement Generation

This document outlines the internal logic, assumptions, and components used to generate California Employment Agreements within the VibeLegal system. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding for replication, improvement, and future development.

## 1. Prompt Format and Structure

The AI model (currently `gpt-3.5-turbo` as configured in `backend/server.js`) receives a combined system and user prompt to generate the contract. The goal is to guide the AI to produce a legally sound, well-formatted, and comprehensive document based on user-provided requirements and pre-defined legal knowledge.

### a. System Prompt

The system prompt establishes the AI's role and fundamental instructions:

```
You are a legal document assistant that generates professional contracts. Always include proper legal disclaimers and formatting.
```

This prompt sets the context, emphasizing professionalism, legal accuracy, and the inclusion of disclaimers.

### b. User Prompt Format

The user prompt is dynamically constructed based on the `contractType`, `jurisdiction`, and specific `requirements` provided by the user, along with party information. For a California Employment Agreement, the prompt is specifically tailored to incorporate California-specific legal nuances.

**General User Prompt (for other contract types or jurisdictions):**

```
Generate a {contractType} for {jurisdiction} with the following requirements: {requirements}.

The contract should be between:
- Client: {clientName}
- Other Party: {otherPartyName}

Include standard legal language, proper formatting, and all necessary clauses. The contract should be comprehensive and professional.

IMPORTANT: Add a disclaimer at the end stating: "LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This document is generated by AI and should be reviewed by a qualified attorney before use. This does not constitute legal advice."

Format the contract with proper headings, numbered sections, and clear structure.
```

**Specific User Prompt for California Employment Agreement:**

When `contractType` is 


`Employment Agreement` and `jurisdiction` is `California`, the prompt is modified to include specific California legal requirements:

```
Generate a comprehensive Employment Agreement for California jurisdiction. The agreement should clearly state the at-will nature of employment, define the position, duties, compensation (including salary, payment schedule, and overtime eligibility), and benefits (health, retirement, PTO). Include standard clauses for confidentiality, return of property, and intellectual property assignment, ensuring strict compliance with California Labor Code Section 2870. Explicitly state that non-compete clauses are generally unenforceable in California and should not be included. If an arbitration clause is requested, ensure it is drafted to meet California enforceability standards. Add a disclaimer that this document should be reviewed by a qualified attorney before use. The specific requirements are: {requirements}.

The contract should be between:
- Client: {clientName}
- Other Party: {otherPartyName}

Format the contract with proper headings, numbered sections, and clear structure.
```

This tailored prompt guides the AI to incorporate specific California legal nuances, such as the at-will doctrine, Labor Code Section 2870 for IP, and the unenforceability of non-compete clauses.

## 2. Legal Assumptions Built into the Generation Logic

The generation logic for California Employment Agreements operates under several key legal assumptions, primarily derived from the `KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md` and `clause_library.json`.

### a. At-Will Employment

- **Assumption**: Employment in California is presumed to be "at-will" unless explicitly stated otherwise in a written agreement. The AI is instructed to include language that reinforces this principle, allowing either party to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice [KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md].
- **Nuance**: While the prompt emphasizes at-will, the system acknowledges that exceptions exist (e.g., public policy, implied contract) and that specific, narrow 


carve-outs (like for-cause termination examples) can be included via options in the `clause_library.json`.

### b. Non-Compete Clauses

- **Assumption**: Non-compete clauses are generally void and unenforceable in California under Business and Professions Code § 16600 [KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md]. The AI is explicitly instructed to avoid including them.
- **Nuance**: The system acknowledges that narrowly tailored non-solicitation and confidentiality clauses are generally enforceable and are included to protect legitimate business interests, distinct from non-competes.

### c. Intellectual Property (IP) Assignment

- **Assumption**: Employers can require employees to assign inventions created within the scope of employment or using company resources. However, California Labor Code § 2870 provides specific exceptions for inventions developed on an employee's own time without employer resources and not related to the employer's business [KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md].
- **Nuance**: The AI is prompted to ensure strict compliance with § 2870, implying the inclusion of the required notice (as provided in `EXHIBITA.md`) and ensuring the assignment clause does not overreach.

### d. Arbitration Clauses

- **Assumption**: Arbitration agreements in employment contexts are generally enforceable in California if they meet specific fairness standards established by case law (e.g., *Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc.*) [KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md].
- **Nuance**: The prompt allows for the request of an arbitration clause and instructs the AI to draft it to meet California enforceability standards, which include mutuality, adequate discovery, cost allocation, and availability of statutory remedies. The `clause_library.json` provides options for specific arbitration providers and class action waivers, acknowledging the complex legal landscape around PAGA claims.

### e. Wage and Hour Compliance

- **Assumption**: The contract will adhere to California's stringent wage and hour laws, including provisions for minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest breaks, and proper employee classification (exempt/non-exempt) [KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md].
- **Nuance**: The prompt specifically mentions compensation details like salary, payment schedule, and overtime eligibility, guiding the AI to generate clauses that reflect these requirements.

## 3. Compliance References and Best Practice Clauses

The system leverages a `clause_library.json` and the `KnowledgeBaseCaliforniaEmploymentContracts.md` to inform the generation of legally compliant and best-practice clauses. The `contract_employment_agreement.json` defines the standard set of clauses to be included for a California Employment Agreement.

Key compliance references and best practice clauses include:

- **At-Will Employment**: Explicitly states the at-will nature of employment, often with language limiting modifications to a formal written agreement signed by a designated officer (`at_will_employment` clause in `clause_library.json`).
- **California Labor Code § 2870 Notice**: The `ip_assignment` clause in `clause_library.json` explicitly references and requires the inclusion of `EXHIBITA.md`, which contains the full text of the California Labor Code § 2870 notice regarding employee rights concerning inventions. This is crucial for the enforceability of IP assignment clauses in California.
- **Non-Compete Prohibition**: The `non_compete_prohibition` clause in `clause_library.json` directly addresses California Business and Professions Code § 16600, stating that non-compete agreements are void and unenforceable, while distinguishing enforceable confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions.
- **Arbitration Compliance**: The `arbitration` clause in `clause_library.json` incorporates the *Armendariz* requirements for enforceability, including mutuality, adequate discovery, cost allocation, and availability of statutory remedies. The `paga_arbitration_notice` clause specifically addresses the complexities of PAGA claims in arbitration, aligning with *Iskanian* and *Viking River Cruises* rulings.
- **Wage and Hour Compliance**: Clauses like `wage_and_hour_compliance`, `meal_rest_breaks_ack`, and `timekeeping_attestation` ensure the contract reflects adherence to California Labor Code provisions regarding minimum wage, overtime, meal/rest periods, and accurate timekeeping.
- **Anti-Discrimination and Harassment**: The `anti_discrimination_harassment` clause emphasizes compliance with FEHA and Title VII, promoting a workplace free from discrimination and harassment.
- **Protected Rights Carve-Out**: The `nlra_protected_rights` clause ensures that nothing in the agreement infringes upon an employee's protected rights under the NLRA or other whistleblower protections.
- **DTSA Whistleblower Notice**: The `dtsa_whistleblower_notice` clause provides the required notice under 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) for trade secret whistleblower immunity.
- **Expense Reimbursement**: The `expense_reimbursement` and `expense_reimbursement_remote` clauses reflect California Labor Code § 2802 requirements for reimbursing necessary business expenses.
- **Background Checks**: `background_check_consent` and `ban_the_box_timing` clauses address compliance with FCRA, ICRAA, and California's fair-chance (ban-the-box) requirements.
- **Immigration Compliance**: The `immigration_compliance` clause ensures adherence to IRCA requirements for verifying employment eligibility.
- **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**: The `governing_law` clause specifies California law and addresses Labor Code § 925 regarding out-of-state litigation/arbitration.
- **Standard Boilerplate**: Includes essential clauses like `entire_agreement`, `severability`, `notice`, and `electronic_signatures` to ensure contractual integrity and enforceability.

## 4. Known Gaps, Edge Cases, or Areas Requiring Manual Review

While the system is designed for robustness and compliance, certain areas inherently require manual review by a qualified attorney due to their complexity, evolving legal landscape, or highly fact-specific nature. These are the 


known gaps and edge cases:

### a. Highly Specific Compensation Structures

- **Gaps**: While the prompt allows for general compensation details, highly complex commission plans, detailed bonus structures, or intricate equity grant agreements (e.g., stock options, RSUs with vesting schedules) require significant manual input and review. The AI can generate basic compensation language, but the specifics of calculation, triggers, and forfeiture would need to be added or verified by a lawyer.
- **Edge Cases**: Performance-based bonuses tied to subjective metrics, multi-year commission clawbacks, or complex equity vesting acceleration clauses upon specific events (e.g., change of control) are beyond the scope of automated generation and require expert drafting.

### b. Executive Employment Agreements

- **Gaps**: Executive agreements often involve bespoke terms related to golden parachutes, change-of-control provisions, deferred compensation, and highly negotiated severance packages. The current system provides a strong foundation but would need substantial customization for executive-level contracts.
- **Edge Cases**: Specific tax implications (e.g., Section 409A), complex indemnification clauses, or D&O insurance provisions are not automatically generated.

### c. Specific Industry Regulations

- **Gaps**: Certain industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, defense, cannabis) have unique regulatory requirements that may impact employment terms (e.g., specific background checks, licensing, ethical codes). The current logic is general and does not account for these industry-specific nuances.
- **Edge Cases**: Contracts for employees handling highly sensitive data (e.g., HIPAA-protected health information) or classified government information would require specialized clauses and compliance checks.

### d. Collective Bargaining Agreements / Unionized Workforces

- **Gaps**: The system is designed for individual employment agreements in non-unionized settings. It does not account for terms dictated by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) or the specific legal framework governing unionized workforces.
- **Edge Cases**: Any employment within a unionized environment would render the generated contract largely irrelevant or in conflict with the CBA.

### e. International or Multi-State Employment

- **Gaps**: While the system specifies California jurisdiction, it does not inherently handle scenarios where an employee might work across multiple states or internationally, which would trigger complex choice-of-law and jurisdictional issues.
- **Edge Cases**: Remote employees residing in different states, or employees who frequently travel for work across state lines, could present jurisdictional challenges not fully addressed by a single-state focus.

### f. Post-Employment Restrictive Covenants (Beyond Non-Compete)

- **Gaps**: While non-competes are void, the enforceability of non-solicitation clauses (of customers or employees) in California is highly fact-specific and subject to ongoing litigation. The AI generates standard language, but its enforceability depends heavily on the specific facts of the employer's business and the employee's role.
- **Edge Cases**: Non-solicitation clauses that are too broad in scope or duration, or that do not adequately protect a legitimate trade secret interest, may be challenged. The AI cannot assess the factual basis for enforceability.

### g. Evolving Legal Landscape

- **Gaps**: California employment law is dynamic, with frequent legislative changes and new court rulings. While the `clause_library.json` has a `last_updated` field, the AI model itself does not have real-time access to legal updates. Manual review is always necessary to ensure the generated contract reflects the absolute latest legal developments.
- **Edge Cases**: Recent laws like SB 699 and AB 1076 (strengthening non-compete prohibition) or new PAGA rulings require constant vigilance. The AI's knowledge is based on its training data and the explicit prompts, which may not capture the very latest nuances.

### h. Specific Employee Accommodations

- **Gaps**: The system does not generate clauses related to specific reasonable accommodations for disabilities (ADA, FEHA) or religious beliefs, which are highly individualized and require direct negotiation and legal advice.

### i. Integration with External Policies/Exhibits

- **Gaps**: While the system references external documents like employee handbooks or Exhibit A (Labor Code 2870 notice), it does not generate these documents or verify their content. A lawyer must ensure these referenced documents are consistent and legally compliant.

## 5. Reusable Prompt Template for Generating New Contracts

To generate a new California Employment Agreement using this logic, the following prompt structure should be used. This combines the system-level instruction with the specific user-provided details and the California-specific legal guidance.

**System Prompt (fixed):**

```
You are a legal document assistant that generates professional contracts. Always include proper legal disclaimers and formatting.
```

**User Prompt (dynamic, based on user input):**

```
Generate a comprehensive Employment Agreement for California jurisdiction. The agreement should clearly state the at-will nature of employment, define the position, duties, compensation (including salary, payment schedule, and overtime eligibility), and benefits (health, retirement, PTO). Include standard clauses for confidentiality, return of property, and intellectual property assignment, ensuring strict compliance with California Labor Code Section 2870. Explicitly state that non-compete clauses are generally unenforceable in California and should not be included. If an arbitration clause is requested, ensure it is drafted to meet California enforceability standards. Add a disclaimer that this document should be reviewed by a qualified attorney before use. The specific requirements are: {user_requirements}.

The contract should be between:
- Client: {client_name}
- Other Party: {other_party_name}

Format the contract with proper headings, numbered sections, and clear structure.
```

**Explanation of Placeholders:**

- `{user_requirements}`: This is a natural language description of the specific needs for the contract, provided by the user. Examples include: 


    - "Software developer position, 90-day probation, $80,000 salary, 15 days PTO"
    - "Marketing manager, remote position, 6-month contract, includes commission structure"
    - "Executive role, requires arbitration clause, 30 days notice for termination"

- `{client_name}`: The name of the client (employer) for whom the contract is being drafted.
- `{other_party_name}`: The name of the other party (employee) to the contract.

This prompt, combined with the AI model's understanding of legal principles and the structured data from the `clause_library.json` and `contract_employment_agreement.json`, forms the core of the California Employment Agreement generation logic.

## Conclusion

The VibeLegal system's approach to generating California Employment Agreements is built on a foundation of specific legal knowledge, carefully crafted prompts, and structured clause management. While designed to produce robust and compliant documents, it acknowledges the inherent complexities of employment law and the necessity of human legal review for edge cases and highly customized scenarios. This detailed logic aims to provide a clear roadmap for further development and enhancement of the AI's capabilities in legal document generation.
